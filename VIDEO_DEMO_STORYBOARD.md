## Narration Script (Optional)

**Style:** Professional, enthusiastic, clear

**Sample Script:**

```
[0:00-0:08] 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized real-time 
rendering, achieving photorealistic quality at 60 frames per second.

[0:08-0:22] But when deployed to the web, the same algorithms 
struggle. Browser constraints, format fragmentation, and performance 
variability create challenges that existing benchmarks simply don't capture.

[0:22-0:40] Introducing WebGSBench—the first web-native benchmark 
for 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our platform enables systematic comparison 
of all major formats: PLY, SPLAT, KSPLAT, and SPZ.

[0:40-1:05] With synchronized camera navigation, researchers can 
make apples-to-apples comparisons, ensuring identical viewpoints 
across different formats and rendering backends.

[1:05-1:20] Built-in quality metrics provide objective assessment. 
PSNR and SSIM calculations reveal exactly how much quality is lost 
when compressing for web deployment.

[1:20-1:40] WebGSBench profiles performance across Chrome, Safari, 
and Firefox, exposing browser-specific optimizations and limitations 
that can make or break user experience.

[1:40-2:00] Our analysis reveals the Pareto frontier of quality 
versus file size, guiding practitioners to optimal format selection 
for their specific constraints.

[2:00-2:25] Beyond static metrics, we characterize temporal stability, 
measuring frame drops during user interaction that traditional 
benchmarks miss entirely.

[2:25-2:55] WebGSBench provides actionable guidelines: use SPZ for 
files under 10 megabytes, KSPLAT for mid-range content, and PLY 
for archival quality. Set performance budgets: under 2 seconds 
load time, over 30 FPS frame rate.

[2:55-3:15] WebGSBench is the first comprehensive framework for 
evaluating 3D Gaussian Splatting under real-world web deployment 
conditions.

[3:15-3:30] Evaluate before you deploy. WebGSBench. Visit our 
GitHub repository to learn more.
